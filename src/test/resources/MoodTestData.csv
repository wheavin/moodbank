I had a wonderful birthday                 ,Happy
I fell asleep peacefully and happy         ,Happy
SHE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME                   ,Happy
It was a very cold winter day              ,Cold
She died in a hateful rage                 ,Serious
I feel so dark and alone right now         ,Depressive
I feel helpless and useless                ,Depressive
I am a long way from home                  ,Melancholic
We watched the sunset and reflected on life,Melancholic
She hugged me and gave me a kiss           ,Romantic
I slammed my fist in a fit of rage         ,Angry
