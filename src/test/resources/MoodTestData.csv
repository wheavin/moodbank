I had a wonderful birthday                                   ,Happy
I fell asleep peacefully and happy                           ,Happy
SHE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME                                     ,Happy
It was a very cold winter day                                ,Cold
She died in a hateful rage                                   ,Serious
I feel so dark and alone right now                           ,Depressive
I feel helpless and useless                                  ,Depressive
There is no hope for us                                      ,Depressive
It had turned cold and the sky was a bleak and charmless grey,Depressive
I am a long way from home                                    ,Melancholic
We watched the sunset and reflected on life                  ,Melancholic
She hugged me and gave me a kiss                             ,Romantic
We fell in love at first sight                               ,Romantic
I slammed my fist in a fit of rage                           ,Angry
I screamed my lungs out in frustration                       ,Angry
They punched and kicked him on the ground                    ,Angry
Forget all we used to know                                   ,Nostalgic
We had good times back then                                  ,Nostalgic
I miss the days we spent during that summer                  ,Nostalgic
