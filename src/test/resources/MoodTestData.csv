It was a very cold winter day              ,Cold
She died in a hateful rage                 ,Serious
I feel so dark and alone right now         ,Depressive
I feel helpless and useless                ,Depressive
There is no hope for us                    ,Depressive
I am a long way from home                  ,Melancholic
We watched the sunset and reflected on life,Melancholic
She hugged me and gave me a kiss           ,Romantic
We fell in love at first sight             ,Romantic
I slammed my fist in a fit of rage         ,Angry

They punched and kicked him on the ground  ,Angry
